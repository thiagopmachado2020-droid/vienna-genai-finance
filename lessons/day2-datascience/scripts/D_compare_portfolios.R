# Purpose: put the two optimized portfolios side by side,
# along with a naive equal weight benchmark, and compare
# weights, return, risk, and Sharpe ratio in one view.
# Run A, B, and C first: this script only reads their output.

# WHY EXPORT? R did every calculation here; this JSON is just
# the finished numbers. That is the course principle in action:
# the math lives in R, and an LLM only reads and interprets the
# result, it never recomputes it. The SPA you build later will
# fetch its own live data instead of this file, but the split
# is the same: numbers are computed in javascript, the model explains them.
#
# To see the interpretation step, open a chatbot such as
# duck.ai, paste the JSON, and try this prompt:
#
#   "You are a portfolio analyst. Below is JSON with three
#    portfolios (equal weight, minimum variance, maximum
#    Sharpe) built from the same five stocks, plus each one's
#    annualized return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. In plain
#    English: (1) explain how the three differ in what they
#    optimize for, (2) point out which names each concentrates
#    in or avoids, (3) name two risks a human should check
#    before trusting these weights. Do not recalculate any
#    numbers; interpret only what is given.
#    <paste portfolio_summary.json here>"

# ---- Closing thought ----
# All three of these portfolios are DRAFTS built from two
# years of history. Before any of them touches real capital,
# a human reviews the weights, questions the inputs, and
# makes the call. Knight Capital automated that final human
# step away, and it cost them the firm in 45 minutes.

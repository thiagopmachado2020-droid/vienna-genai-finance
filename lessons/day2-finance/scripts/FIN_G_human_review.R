# FIN_G_human_review.R
# Human review surface, Day 2, Finance Masters track
# Bridge from R analysis to the vibe coded SPA (Hour 3)
#
# Purpose: assemble everything the morning produced into ONE
# artifact a human can review before it turns into a research
# note. Then hand that artifact, plus a prompt, off to a
# chatbot for the plain English write up.
#
# ============================================================
# THE HUMAN REVIEW SURFACE
# ============================================================
#
# Every script this morning produced a piece of a bigger
# picture. FIN_A showed the raw transcript. FIN_B pulled macro
# alerts. FIN_C pulled press coverage. FIN_D assembled those
# three into a context block and got the first research note.
# FIN_E scored sentiment turn by turn. FIN_F extracted
# entities, figures, and guidance.
#
# None of those on their own is a review surface. THIS script
# builds the review surface: one JSON file that gathers every
# piece of evidence and every derived label into one place, so
# a human can open it, read it, and decide whether it should
# become a research note that gets shared.
#
# This phrase is worth remembering. The human review surface
# is the checkpoint that Knight Capital skipped. Knight had
# code that acted the moment it fired. There was no surface,
# no artifact, no human between the model and the market. When
# you assemble the review surface deliberately and read it
# before publishing, you are doing the thing Knight did not.
#
# ============================================================
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES AND DOES NOT DO
# ============================================================
#
# It does: read the outputs of FIN_D, FIN_E, and FIN_F, and
#          combine them into one JSON file and one companion
#          prompt file that a student pastes into any chatbot
#          (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, duck.ai) to get the final
#          research note.
#
# It does NOT: call an LLM. Zero API calls in this script.
#              Every LLM call happens in the chatbot the
#              you choose, outside R. That is the point.
#              The interpretation step is portable. The review
#              surface is not tied to any one model.
#
# Your SPA:
# In Hour 3 you rebuild everything this morning did in
# JavaScript, inside a single page application. Same shape,
# same split: code collects and structures the evidence, an
# LLM interprets the finished evidence. The JSON here
# is the object your SPA will build & produce a note.

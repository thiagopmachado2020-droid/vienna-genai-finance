# FIN_F_extraction.R
# NER and extraction lesson, Day 2, Finance Masters track
#
# Purpose: pull structured facts out of an earnings call. From
# each speaker turn we extract five categories: companies,
# executives, products, financial figures with values, and
# forward looking statements. Everything comes back in a JSON
# object with the shape we asked for.
#
# How to use this script: run it a block at a time and read
# what prints. The first row is the interesting one, again.
# Watch how the model separates a company from a product from
# a person, then follow the loop.
#
# WHAT'S THE SAME AS FIN_E.
# httr2 with retry, JSON schema validation, open weight model
# by default, per row calls, one call per turn. The pedagogy
# from FIN_E carries. If you skipped FIN_E, read its header.
#
# WHAT'S NEW HERE.
#
# 1. A larger schema. Five fields instead of two, some of them
#    arrays of strings and some of them arrays of objects.
#    Schemas can nest, and the model will fill in a shape it
#    has never seen as long as the shape is described clearly.
#
# 2. An example in the system prompt. For sentiment, "positive
#    phrase" is intuitive. For extraction, "financial figure"
#    could mean many things (a raw number, a percentage, a
#    dollar amount tied to a metric). A worked example inside
#    the prompt pins down what we mean. Read it below and
#    notice how much interpretation it removes.
#
# 3. Two output shapes. A per turn data frame that you can
#    read row by row (who said what), and a call level
#    aggregate that dedupes entities and lists every figure
#    and every forward looking statement with its speaker.
#    FIN_G reads the aggregate.
#
# THE FIVE CATEGORIES, IN PLAIN LANGUAGE.
# companies:                 named third parties (competitors,
#                            customers, partners). NOT the
#                            reporting company itself.
# executives:                named people, with their role.
# products:                  distinct product lines, services,
#                            or business segments.
# financial_figures:         a number tied to what it measures.
#                            "$51 billion" alone is not enough,
#                            "$51 billion in iPhone revenue" is.
# forward_looking_statements: any claim about the future.
#                            "we expect", "we guide", "next
#                            quarter", "into 2026".

# FIN_E_sentiment.R
# Sentiment lesson, Day 2, Finance Masters track
#
# Purpose: score sentiment across an entire earnings call by
# asking a language model to identify positive and negative
# phrases in every speaker turn. The result is a data frame
# you can slice by speaker, roll up to a role group, or
# reduce to one overall label for the call.
#
# How to use this script: run it a block at a time and read
# what prints. The first row is the interesting one. Watch
# what the model returns for that turn before the loop starts,
# then follow the loop.
#
# THREE THINGS THAT ARE NEW IN THIS SCRIPT.
#
# 1. httr2 with retry. Every call in this script is one of
#    fifty or more, and a single network hiccup should not
#    force a rerun of the whole loop. httr2's req_retry()
#    gives us backoff and retry in one line, which is what
#    you want any time you loop over an API.
#
# 2. JSON schema validation. Instead of asking the model to
#    "please return JSON" and cleaning up the result, we hand
#    it a schema. OpenRouter enforces the shape at the
#    provider layer, so the response arrives already parseable.
#    No fence stripping, no missing field surprises.
#
# 3. Open weight versus closed weight. The model we use here
#    is open weight, meaning its parameters are published under
#    a permissive license. Closed weight models like Gemini and
#    Claude keep their parameters private. Both call the same
#    way through OpenRouter. Open weight models cost less per
#    token, could run on your own hardware if you ever needed
#    to, and cannot be silently deprecated by a provider.
#    Closed weight models tend to be stronger at the frontier
#    of capability, but for a bounded task like sentiment
#    classification the gap has closed. This is a good place
#    to use open weight and pocket the savings.
#
# APPROACH: PER ROW, NOT BATCHED.
# We send one API call per speaker turn. That is slower and
# more expensive than putting the whole transcript into one
# request and asking for a JSON array back. We do it this way
# on purpose. Per row, you see the mechanic clearly on the
# first turn, and if any single call fails you inspect just
# that one. Batched is the right choice in production once
# you trust the shape. Ask about it if you want the pattern.
#
# APPROACH: BINARY LABELS, DENSITY WEIGHTED AGGREGATION.
# The model returns lists of positive and negative phrases
# per turn. We do not ask it for a numeric score. We derive
# the label ourselves from the counts and the length of the
# passage, so the arithmetic is visible and auditable. A CEO
# using ten positive phrases in a hundred words is more
# positive than the same ten positive phrases in a thousand
# words, and the density metric captures that.

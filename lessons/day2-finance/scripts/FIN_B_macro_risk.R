# FIN_B_macro_risk.R
# LLM Context lesson, Day 2, Finance Masters track
#
# Purpose: pull live macro and geopolitical risk alerts, and
# think about what belongs in a context window and what is
# just noise.
#
# How to use this script: run it a block at a time and read
# what prints.
#
# This is your first API call of the day and it needs NO KEY.
# Riskline publishes these alerts openly, so nothing can go
# wrong with authentication. In FIN_C we add a key.

# Always check the response before trusting it. A failed
# request still returns an object, it just has no useful data

# of a response first is the habit that saves the most time.

# FILTER TO WHAT MATTERS
# ============================================================

# A global risk feed contains alerts about dozens of countries. 
# Nearly all of them are irrelevant to any single investment thesis. 
# Sending all of them to a language model costs money and, 
# buries the relevant signal in noise.

# Before filtering, see which countries actually appear in this real time GET response.

cat("Countries present in this feed:\n")
t(t(table(alerts$country.name)))
  
# Assuming out interest countries are in the data pull
relevant <- alerts[alerts$country.name %in% COUNTRIES_OF_INTEREST, ]

  relevant$title
  } else {
  print('No current alerts for countries of interest.  Review the table of country names')
    }


# ============================================================
# TURN IT INTO CONTEXT
# ============================================================

# A language model cannot read a data frame. Context has to
# be text. Here we compress the filtered alerts into a short
# block that would sit inside a prompt
buildMacroContext <- function(risk_alerts){
  # Check we have existing alerts
  if(nrow(risk_alerts)==0){
    macroBlock <- 'No significant macro risk alerts for the regions of interest.'
  } else {
    macroBlock <- apply(risk_alerts[,1:2],1, paste0, collapse = '\n')
    macroBlock <- paste(macroBlock, collapse = '\n')
  }
  macroBlock <- paste('CURRENT MACRO RISK ALERTS\n',
                      macroBlock,
                      collapse = '\n')
 return(macroBlock) 
}

macro_context <- buildMacroContext(relevant)

cat("---- The context block ----\n")
cat(macro_context, "\n\n")

cat("Size of this block:", nchar(macro_context), "characters\n")
cat("Roughly", round(nchar(macro_context) / 4), "tokens\n\n")

# TIP: compare that number to the transcript size from FIN_A.
# Macro risk is tiny. It is cheap to include and it tells the
# model something it could not possibly infer from a company's
# own earnings call. That combination, high value and low
# cost, is exactly what you want in a context window.
#
# Also notice how little this feed actually carries: a title,
# a timestamp, a country, and a link to a flag image. There is
# no body text and no severity score. The headline IS the
# alert. That is a limitation worth knowing before you build
# anything on top of it, and it is the kind of thing you only
# discover by printing the field names first.

# ============================================================
# SAVE IT
# ============================================================

# FIN_D assembles this together with the transcript and news
# into a single prompt.
pth <- file.path(savePth, "macro_context.rds") # THIS WILL OVERWRITE OLD MACRO RDS
